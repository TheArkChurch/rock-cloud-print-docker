## Run Rock Cloud Print in a Docker Container (Linux / Raspberry Pi)

Hey Rock community! 👋

If you're using Rock's Cloud Print Proxy for check-in label printing and your server is cloud-hosted, you know the challenge: the official Rock Cloud Print app is Windows-only. That's fine if you have a Windows machine on your network, but it's overkill if you just want something small, always-on, and low-maintenance.

We've been running a community-maintained Docker port at our church and wanted to share it in case it helps anyone else.

---

### What it does

Rock Cloud Print is a lightweight proxy that sits between your Rock server and local network printers. Rock sends print jobs over a WebSocket, and the proxy forwards them as raw TCP data (ZPL, etc.) to the printer on port 9100.

```
Rock Server  ──WebSocket──▶  This container  ──TCP:9100──▶  Local Zebra/TSC Printer
```

The official Windows app handles this perfectly — this Docker version does the exact same thing, we repackaged it to run headlessly on any Linux box. We run it on Raspberry Pi's 4/5 that we already had(a few of them). It will also work on most NAS systems who support containers.

---

### What's different from the original

| Original | This version |
|---|---|
| Windows Service | Docker container (Linux, ARM64/AMD64) |
| WPF desktop app | Browser-based web UI on port 8080 |
| Named pipe IPC | REST API |
| EventLog | `docker compose logs` / in-app log panel |
| Windows installer | `docker compose up --build` |

The core WebSocket/TCP proxy logic is untouched — we only replaced the Windows-specific shell around it.

---

### Requirements

- A Linux server (or Raspberry Pi running Debian/Ubuntu) **on the same network as your printers**
- Docker and the Compose plugin
- Rock v17+ with a Cloud Print Proxy device record

That's it. No .NET SDK, no Visual Studio, no Windows.

---

### Getting set up Linux:

**1. Install Docker** (if not already installed):
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**2. Copy the project to your server** and build/start the container:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

**3. Open `http://<server-ip>:8080`** and go to Settings. Enter your Rock server URL and Proxy ID (the Device IdKey from Admin Tools → Check-in → Cloud Print Proxies).

**4. Check the Dashboard.** You should see a green "Connected" dot within a few seconds.

---

### For other instalation methods see the docker hub repo.

### A few tips we learned the hard way

**Use your origin URL, not your primary domain.**  
If your Rock site is behind Cloudflare or another CDN, WebSocket upgrade requests are blocked at the CDN level. You'll see `400` instead of `101` in the logs. Use the direct origin URL (e.g. `https://origin.yourchurch.com` or the bare IP of your web server) to bypass the CDN.

**Use the IdKey, not the GUID.**  
When grabbing the Proxy ID from Rock, copy the short `IdKey` value (like `da0BJR0Bpz`), not the long GUID. Both technically work but the IdKey is what the proxy handshake expects.

**Host networking is required on Linux.**  
The `docker-compose.yml` uses `network_mode: host` so the container can reach printers at their raw LAN IPs. This is a Linux-only Docker feature — it won't work on Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows, but that's fine since those aren't server environments anyway.

---

### Web UI

The browser UI lives at port 8080. It has three tabs:

- **Dashboard** — connection status (green/amber/grey dot), uptime, labels printed counter
- **Logs** — live service log stream, color-coded by level, auto-scrolling
- **Settings** — Rock server URL, Proxy ID, Proxy Name, and an optional PIN for web UI protection

There's also a **Restart** button in the header that gracefully restarts the container (Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` policy brings it right back).

---

### PIN protection

The web UI is open by default — anyone who can reach port 8080 can view and change settings. If your server is exposed at all, set a PIN under Settings → Security. You can also pre-configure it via an environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - Password=mypin
```

---

### Auto-start on reboot

The container uses `restart: unless-stopped`, so it comes back automatically after a Docker crash. For full boot persistence, add a systemd unit:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable rock-cloudprint
```

(Full unit file in the repo README.)

---

### Where to find it

Docker Hub: **https://hub.docker.com/r/asdfinit/rock-cloudprint**

The README has a full admin guide covering prerequisites, quick start, configuration, troubleshooting, CDN tips, and all of the above. Happy to answer questions here or in the repo.

Would love to hear if anyone else has a setup like this or has any idea for improvements(I have a few ideas)
